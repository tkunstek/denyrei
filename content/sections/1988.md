# 1988 Commitments
There are special restrictions on this property from the [1988 Committments](/1988.pdf). Specifically, the Plan Commission has the power to stop any development on the property for any reason whatsoever, even if the proposed project meets zoning and requires zero variances. This property was intended as a buffer for the adjacent homes. Please encourage the Plan Commission to enforce the original commitments.
