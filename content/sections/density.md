# Density
The proposed plan crams ten apartment buildings with 236 units, 400 parking spaces, and two commercial outlots into approximately 22 acres.  This project will greatly increase noise, traffic, and light pollution. Crime will increase. Children living in the project are miles away from the nearest park. Carmel school busses and classrooms are packed to overflowing.
