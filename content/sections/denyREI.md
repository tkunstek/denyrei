# Deny REI

REI is proposing a 236 unit apartment complex at the former Altum's Nursery site at 11335 Michigan Road between 106th and 116th street in Carmel. 

This high-density apartment complex will back up to and tower over existing homes, increase traffic, and crowd our already packed school busses and classrooms.

You can help by sending a short two paragraph [email](mailto:jshestak@carmel.in.gov?cc=mnelson@carmel.in.gov&subject=Docket%20No.%20PZ-2021-00205%20DP%2FADLS%3A%2011335%20N.%20Michigan%20Rd.%20Apartments) opposing the project to the plan commission.
