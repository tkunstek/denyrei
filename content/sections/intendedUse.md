# Intended Use

REI would not need SEVEN variances to build apartments here if it was a good fit for the site.  The intended use does not fit the site as specified in the B-3 Zoning, 421 Overlay, Carmel Comprehensive Plan, and Sellers Commitments from 1988. The original agreement for this land from the commitments was that it was to be used for transitional use and was never intended for multi-family housing.
