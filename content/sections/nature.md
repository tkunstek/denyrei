# Nature
The current project site is currently a beautiful greenspace with two lakes, trees, and open fields. The property is home to water fowl, beavers, deer, and bald eagles are reguarly seen by residents adjacent to this property. This is likely the last place for the city to acquire park property in West District #6 - Precinct 205 - Clay Southwest 1. 

The nearest Carmel park to this site is West Park which is a hazards 46 minute trek along 116th St. without sidewalks. Not only will we be denying future citiziens this space, but the poor children who live in these apartments will have nowhere to go.
