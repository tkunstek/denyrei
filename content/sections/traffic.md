# Traffic

The proposed project would add 400 parking spaces and a new stop light at Bennet Parkway - just 150 feet north of the new light at Weston Pointe. Michigan Road is already congested with traffic backing up a mile during rush hour daily and 400 more cars and additional stoplights will exacerbate the problem.
